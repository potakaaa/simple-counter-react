# 🎉 Simple Counter App 🚀

Welcome to my **Simple Counter App** — a starter project for diving into the world of **ReactJS**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**! This project is my first step in learning modern front-end development tools while keeping things fun and practical.

## 🌟 Features

✨ A simple yet functional counter with increment, decrement, and reset features.  
✨ Built to explore and understand React hooks, state management, and TypeScript integration.  
✨ Perfect for experimenting with Vite's speedy development workflow.
